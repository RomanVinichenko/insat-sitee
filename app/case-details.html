            <h3>1. Context</h3>
            <p>
              Our customer is a US-based eLearning company specializing in parenting education. They create and provide
              a variety of educational courses, including a curriculum that teaches high school educators how to teach
              parenting classes to students.
            </p>
            <p>
              The customer used a learning management system (LMS) as a means to deliver their educational courses and
              learning programs, but the solution did not meet their needs fully. The legacy LMS didn’t have the
              required functionality for schools onboarding and exporting student submissions to external platforms and
              couldn’t support some processes and automations. Initially, the customer wanted to upgrade the solution
              but had to abandon the plan because the software was closed-source and customizations would be difficult
              to implement. Eventually, the company decided to go for a new solution, equipped, apart from LMS-specific
              features, with features for selecting new schools for program participation and onboarding them, digitally
              signing documents, and automating certain processes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, the customer needed a technology consultant and software vendor that would analyze the LMS
              solutions on the market, choose the one that met their requirements and aligned with their business
              processes, and carried out its implementation. The customer considered Itransition a good fit for this
              project as we have accumulated vast expertise in eLearning and LMS consulting and have successfully
              implemented multiple relevant projects.
            </p>
            <h3>2. Solution</h3>
            <p>
              Itransition delivered an eLearning platform based on Odoo. The solution allows for organizing online
              lectures, conducting tests and surveys, and selecting schools to participate in the program, as well as
              enabling teacher-student communication and online meetings. The platform also has features for document
              management, including e-signature, billing, and report generation. Finally, we built a new website and
              customized it to serve as a client portal facilitating school onboarding and course management.
            </p>
            <span>
            Each school can choose when the program should start, so upon commencement, students get access to the course. After each lesson, students submit lesson reflection and take a quiz, while teachers submit lesson quality assessment. At the end of the semester, students submit their final project and finish the course, receiving the course completion certificate.
          </span>
            <h5>
              Discovery
            </h5>
            <p>
              Itransition’s team managed to complete the discovery phase in a couple of weeks instead of a month as
              initially planned. We reviewed the customer’s school and teacher onboarding workflow, the overall
              educational process, and the functionality of their current LMS. We also thoroughly examined the
              customer’s business processes and visualized them in the form of diagrams.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eventually, we figured out that the customer needed a full-blown ERP system instead of an LMS, open-source
              and easily customizable in line with the project’s needs. The speed of implementation was also an
              important consideration since the platform was expected to be launched in time for the upcoming academic
              year.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our team analyzed around 10 ERP/LMS solutions comparing them based on 30+ available features. Eventually,
              we picked the four best-fitting options, among which were Moodle, Odoo Community (CE) and Odoo Enterprise
              (EE), and LifterLMS, a WordPress-based LMS.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having compared the solutions, we concluded that the system built on top of the Odoo ERP platform was the
              best solution as it matched the customer’s requirements and allowed the customer to get started quickly
              and at a comparably low cost. We also chose Odoo Enterprise for its full-fledged accounting features and
              an in-built electronic document signature feature.
            </p>
            <p>
              What is more, Odoo Enterprise can be hosted on the Odoo.sh dedicated cloud platform, so we could deploy
              the eLearning platform in a couple of clicks. Last but not least, being an Odoo Silver Partner,
              Itransition has already developed wide expertise in implementing and customizing Odoo solutions.
            </p>
            <h5>
              Business process enablement
            </h5>
            <p>
              At the beginning of this stage, our business analyst prepared the detailed diagrams of the customer’s
              business processes in line with the modules to be implemented and visualized the capabilities the new
              system enables.
            </p>
            <h5>
              Application
            </h5>
            <p>
              School representatives have to fill in application surveys, entering various data about their school, to
              participate in the training program. After the application is submitted, the system creates an opportunity
              in CRM. The customer then reviews the application and decides whether a school can be onboarded for the
              coming academic year.
            </p>
            <h5>
              Preparation
            </h5>
            <p>
              As soon as the school’s application is accepted, it needs to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)
              based on the template our team prepared. After that, the opportunity automatically proceeds to the next
              stage, with the system creating a project and sending the client a customization survey and invitation to
              the teacher course. After the client submits the customization survey, they can upload teachers’ contacts
              to the system. The system sends course invitations to contacts provided by the teacher and notifies them
              about scheduled live webinars, while the customer’s employees create a customized course.
            </p>
            <h5>
              Training
            </h5>
            <p>
              Teachers enroll in the course and undergo training, which includes both webinars on using the system and
              learning materials for teaching students. In case teachers need technical assistance, they can schedule a
              meeting with the customer’s employees. When the training is completed, the system notifies employees and
              sends teachers a course satisfaction survey. Teachers take the survey, get their annual certificate, and
              upload the list of students with their personal accounts on the web portal, with all students linked to
              the teacher.
            </p>

                OpenEduCat, a third-party LMS module responsible for implementing the training program, managing

            <h5>Course delivery</h5>
            <p>Each school can choose when the program should start, so upon commencement, students get access to the
              course. After each lesson, students submit lesson reflection and take a quiz, while teachers submit lesson
              quality assessment. At the end of the semester, students submit their final project and finish the course,
              receiving the course completion certificate.
